## Introduction
The primary goal of this analysis is to perform EDA on the hotel booking dataset to identify:
- Patterns and relationships in booking data.
- Factors affecting booking cancellations.
- Key insights on customer demographics, preferences, and behavior.

---

## Dataset Information
**Dataset Source**: [Link to dataset source or description]  
**Features**:
- `Hotel`: Type of hotel (e.g., City, Resort)
- `is_canceled`: Whether the booking was canceled (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- `lead_time`: Number of days between booking and check-in
- `number_of_guests`: Total number of guests
- `room_type`: Type of room booked
- `price`: Price per night

---

## Libraries and Setup
The following libraries are used for data analysis and visualization:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

## EDA Process

### 1. Data Loading
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

```python
# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('hotel_bookings.csv')
data.head()
```

### 2. Basic Data Exploration
- **Data Shape**: Check the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
- **Column Information**: List the column names and data types.
- **Statistical Summary**: Obtain a statistical summary to understand the range, mean, median, etc., for each column.

```python
print(data.shape)          # Rows and columns
print(data.columns)        # Column names
print(data.info())         # Data types and non-null counts
print(data.describe())     # Statistical summary
```

### 3. Data Cleaning
- **Check for Missing Values**: Identify columns with missing data and decide on an appropriate filling or dropping method.
- **Outlier Detection**: Use box plots or statistical methods to identify and handle outliers.
- **Duplicate Rows**: Check for and remove duplicate entries.

```python
# Missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Filling missing values
data['column_name'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Drop duplicates
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

### 4. Univariate Analysis
Analyze individual columns to understand their distribution and characteristics.

#### Examples:
- **Categorical Variables**: Use bar charts for `Hotel`, `room_type`, `is_canceled`.
- **Numerical Variables**: Use histograms for `lead_time`, `price`.

```python
# Example for categorical variable
sns.countplot(x='Hotel', data=data)
plt.title("Distribution of Hotel Types")
plt.show()

# Example for numerical variable
sns.histplot(data['lead_time'], kde=True)
plt.title("Distribution of Lead Time")
plt.show()
```

### 5. Bivariate Analysis
Analyze relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations and patterns.

#### Examples:
- **Hotel Type vs. Booking Cancellations**: Explore if one hotel type has a higher cancellation rate.
- **Price vs. Number of Guests**: Understand if price increases with the number of guests.

```python
# Cancellation rate by hotel type
sns.countplot(x='Hotel', hue='is_canceled', data=data)
plt.title("Cancellation Rate by Hotel Type")
plt.show()

# Scatter plot for price vs. number of guests
sns.scatterplot(x='number_of_guests', y='price', data=data)
plt.title("Price vs. Number of Guests")
plt.show()
```

### 6. Multivariate Analysis
Explore relationships between multiple variables simultaneously to uncover deeper insights.

#### Example:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Create a heatmap to show correlations among numerical variables.

```python
# Correlation matrix
corr_matrix = data.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")
plt.show()
```

- Key insights into cancellation rates.
- Important factors affecting booking behavior.

## Introduction
In this project, we conduct a comprehensive EDA and data engineering process on hotel booking data to analyze patterns, prepare data for modeling, and extract useful insights.

---

## Dataset Information
**Source**: [Dataset Source Link]  
**Key Columns**:
- `Hotel`: Type of hotel (City or Resort).
- `is_canceled`: Booking cancellation status (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- `lead_time`: Days between booking and check-in.
- `number_of_guests`: Number of guests in the booking.
- `room_type`: Room type booked.
- `price`: Price per night.

```python
print(data.shape)
print(data.info())
print(data.describe())
```

---

## Data Engineering

### 1. Feature Engineering
Add new features to improve insights and model performance:
- **Booking Duration**: Calculate the total duration of each stay.
- **Booking Lead Category**: Group lead times into categories for easier analysis.

```python
# Add booking duration feature
data['booking_duration'] = data['checkout_date'] - data['checkin_date']

# Categorize lead times
data['lead_time_category'] = pd.cut(data['lead_time'], bins=[0, 7, 30, 90, 365],
                                    labels=['Short', 'Medium', 'Long', 'Very Long'])
```

### 2. Data Transformation
Scale or transform data if needed for better distribution:
- **Log Transformation**: To normalize skewed data, like `lead_time` or `price`.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: For categorical variables like `room_type` and `lead_time_category`.

```python
# Log transformation
data['lead_time_log'] = np.log1p(data['lead_time'])

# One-hot encode categorical variables
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['room_type', 'lead_time_category'], drop_first=True)
```

### 3. Handling Class Imbalance
If the target variable (e.g., `is_canceled`) is imbalanced, handle it using techniques like:
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**
- **Undersampling** of the majority class

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Assuming X is features and y is the target
sm = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_res, y_res = sm.fit_resample(X, y)
```

---

## Further Analysis and Modeling Preparation

### 1. Statistical Analysis
Perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses:
- **Chi-Square Test**: For categorical variables, like `Hotel` and `is_canceled`.
- **ANOVA**: For differences in numerical features, like `price` across categories.

```python
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, f_oneway

# Chi-Square Test
contingency = pd.crosstab(data['Hotel'], data['is_canceled'])
chi2, p, _, _ = chi2_contingency(contingency)

# ANOVA
f_stat, p_val = f_oneway(data[data['Hotel'] == 'City']['price'],
                         data[data['Hotel'] == 'Resort']['price'])
```

### 2. Preparing for Machine Learning
Split data into train and test sets, scale, and encode features for model training.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Splitting the data
X = data.drop(['is_canceled'], axis=1)
y = data['is_canceled']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standard scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

---

## Conclusion
This EDA and data engineering process provides insights into hotel booking data, including customer preferences, factors affecting cancellations, and patterns in lead time and room type. The data engineering process prepares the data for effective machine learning modeling, addressing imbalanced data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.

---

## Future Work
1. **Predictive Modeling**: Build a model to predict booking cancellations.
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Create more insightful features, such as `seasonality` based on check-in date.
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze booking patterns over time, especially by month or year.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: For customer reviews, if available, to understand sentiment trends.
